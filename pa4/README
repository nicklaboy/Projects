COLORIZATION: Intro to AI
For this project we had to take a picture (has to have some decent color variations so I did beach
pictures) and we had to take the five most prominent color in the pictures, then use this and recolor
a black and white image of the same picture with the 5 most prominent colors. This required the use
of training data to train the model to recolor the black and white picture as accuratley as possible.
For the improved agent, the implementation of K-Mean++ was used to improve the final result of the
recolored image.
